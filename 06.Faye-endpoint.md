# Faye

At Gitter we use Faye extensibly to publish real-time messages regarding user and room activity to all our clients.

## What is Faye?

> Faye is a publish-subscribe messaging system based on the Bayeux protocol.

## Endpoints

We provide Faye endpoints that look like our REST API. When a user subscribes to them, she will receive real-time activity regarding those resources:

A user can subscribe to the following endpoints:

 - `/api/v1/user/:userId/rooms` 
 - `/api/v1/user/:userId/rooms/:roomId/unreadItems`
 - `/api/v1/user/:userId`
 - `/api/v1/rooms/:roomId`: Room user presence.
 - `/api/v1/rooms/:roomId/chatMessages`: Room messages.
 - `/api/v1/rooms/:roomId/users`: Room users.
 - `/api/v1/rooms/:roomId/events`: Room events.
 - `/api/v1/rooms/:roomId/chatMessages/:messageId/readBy`

## Consuming messages

To consume messages from Faye you'll need to use one of the provided clients.

- [Gitter Realtime Client](https://github.com/gitterHQ/realtime-client) - a higher-level abstraction than a straight Faye client.
 - [Browser clients](http://faye.jcoglan.com/browser.html) 
 - [Server-side Node.js clients](http://faye.jcoglan.com/node/clients.html)
 - [Server-side Ruby clients](http://faye.jcoglan.com/ruby/clients.html)
