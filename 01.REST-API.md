# REST API

Use the REST API to get information about rooms and post messages.

* [Authentication](authentication)
* [Room resource](rooms-resource)
* [Message resource](messages-resource)
* [User resource](user-resource)


## HTTP Methods
We try to uphold RESTful principles in the API. Listing, showing and other non-state-altering actions are done with _GET_, creating with _POST_, _PUT_ for updating and deleting with _DELETE_.

## URL Breakdown

```

* `https`: The Gitter API is served over secure HTTP *only*.
* `v1`: API version.
* `rooms`: The resource which is being requested.
* `roomId`: The ID of the `Room`.
* `chatMessages`: The sub-resource, a resource which is accessed in the scope of the parent resource. For example, all the messages in a room. In some cases there may be multiple sub-resources.
